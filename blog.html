          <h3>Intro: Why I Started This Blog</h3>
          <p><time datetime="2025-08-01">August 1, 2025</time></p>
          <p>Hey! I'm Keane. After working on multiple projects — from Minecraft server tools to full-stack apps — I decided to create a space where I can document thoughts, plans, and lessons learned. This blog is as much for my future self as it is for anyone else curious about my work. Expect honest devlogs, ideas in progress, tech rabbit holes, and maybe a few rants.</p>

          <h3>Minecraft Server Automation Project: Approaching Beta</h3>
          <p><time datetime="2025-08-06">August 6, 2025</time></p>
          <p>I'm excited to announce that the free version of Night's Auto MC Server Setup is nearing completion! The core functionality is now implemented, and I'm preparing to enter the pre beta testing phase next week. The application streamlines the entire Minecraft server setup process, making it accessible for players who want to host their own servers without dealing with configurations.</p>
          <p>Currently, I'm implementing a secure testing key system that will allow the beta testers to access the application during the initial testing period. This controlled rollout will help gather valuable feedback and ensure everything works smoothly before the public release.</p>

          <p>The link is up! I'm waiting for testers to start testing the app and then can improve on the app.</p>
